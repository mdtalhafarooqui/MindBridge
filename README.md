Bridging Students to Mental Well-Being

MindBridge is a student-centric digital mental health support platform designed to address the growing youth mental health crisis on Indian campuses. It combines thoughtful UX, structured logic, and ethical AI assistance to provide early support, emotional awareness, and crisis routing—without replacing professional care.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Indian students face intense academic pressure, competitive environments, social expectations, and limited access to mental health professionals.  
Due to stigma and lack of awareness, emotional distress often goes unnoticed until it becomes severe.

Institutions lack scalable, data-driven systems to track emotional well-being, detect early warning signs, and provide safe, timely support.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

MindBridge acts as a digital companion that quietly supports students through self-assessment, guided emotional interaction, journaling, and crisis detection.

It is not a diagnostic tool—it is a preventive, supportive system designed to encourage timely help-seeking and emotional awareness.
